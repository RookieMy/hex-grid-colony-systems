# Hex Grid Colony Systems

A systems-focused strategy prototype built in Unity that explores scalable architecture for tile-based colony simulations.

This project emphasizes gameplay systems over visual polish, demonstrating how modular mechanics can interact to create an emergent strategy experience.

## 🚀 Project Focus

Rather than building a full game, this prototype was developed to explore **strategy-oriented gameplay systems** such as:

* Hex-grid based world architecture
* Modular building placement rules
* Fog-of-war exploration
* Resource economy pipelines
* Energy production / consumption constraints
* Tile data management

The goal was to design systems that are **scalable, maintainable, and expandable** — mirroring production-minded engineering practices.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This prototype reflects my interest in designing gameplay systems that prioritize **interaction, scalability, and systemic depth** rather than scripted behavior.

It represents my approach to engineering-first game development.
